        <p>This summer Madrid will become a centre of Pop Art, with the exhibition <strong>Pop Art Myths</strong> organised by the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, and an exhibition at the Museo Reina Sof√≠a focusing on one of the great protagonists of Pop Art, <strong>Richard Hamilton</strong>.</p>

<p>Both exhibitions, made up of more than 300 works of art, look at the traditional myths of the Pop movement in a different light, highlighting the turbulence of a society that sought to forget the trauma of war. It also takes a critical view of the boom of mass culture and the new consumer society.
